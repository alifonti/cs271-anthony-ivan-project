# Stackjack

*Stackjack* is a text-based version of the popular card game known as "Blackjack" or "Twenty One." It has a full list of features that emulate the real game (including Table Play for up to seven people) so that Stackjack can be both an entertaining and an educational experience for those looking to learn the game.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Stackjack is a lightweight project, all you need to get the game running is Java.

### Running the Game (GUI Version)

Download the most recent GUI version in our repository ([v0.1-gui](https://github.com/alifonti/cs271-anthony-ivan-project/releases/tag/v0.1-gui)) and then build and run `StackJack.java`. The files must be on a local (not remote) computer so that the game can utilize the display.

### Running the Game (Text/Console Version)

Download the most recent text version in our repository ([v1.0-text](https://github.com/alifonti/cs271-anthony-ivan-project/releases/tag/v1.0-console)) and simply build and run `Main.java` to begin. If the file is being viewed in Cloud9, use the "Run" prompt on `Main.java` to start the game.
